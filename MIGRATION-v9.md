# Migrating to JustSaying v9

> Draft — accumulates the breaking changes as the v9 work lands. Becomes the v9 release notes / docs migration page when v9 ships.

## Dropping the `Message` base-class constraint

The public APIs no longer require messages to derive from `JustSaying.Models.Message`. Every API that was `where T : Message` is now `where T : class`, so you can publish and handle any reference type.

- `Message` still exists and works unchanged, and message classes that derive from it need no changes.
- You may now use plain DTOs, records, or types from other libraries as messages.
- This includes the container registration helpers: `AddJustSayingHandler<TMessage, THandler>` and `AddJustSayingHandlers<TMessage>` (Microsoft DI) and `Registry.AddJustSayingHandler<TMessage, THandler>` (StructureMap) are now `where TMessage : class`.

### Extension points that took a `Message` now take an `object`

Widening the constraint means the *framework's* callbacks can no longer promise a `Message`. If you implement or configure any of these, the signature has changed and your code needs a source update — even if all your messages still derive from `Message`:

| Extension point | v8 | v9 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IMessageMonitor.Handled` | `Handled(Message message)` | `Handled(object message)` |
| `IMessageBackoffStrategy.GetBackoffDuration` | `(Message message, int approximateReceiveCount, Exception lastException = null)` | `(object message, int approximateReceiveCount, Exception lastException = null)` |
| `IPublishConfiguration.MessageResponseLogger` (and `MessagingConfigurationBuilder.WithMessageResponseLogger`) | `Action<MessageResponse, Message>` | `Action<MessageResponse, object>` |
| `IPublishBatchConfiguration.MessageBatchResponseLogger` (and `MessagingConfigurationBuilder.WithMessageResponseLogger`) | `Action<MessageBatchResponse, IReadOnlyCollection<Message>>` | `Action<MessageBatchResponse, IReadOnlyCollection<object>>` |
| `SnsWriteConfiguration.HandleException` / `SnsWriteConfigurationBuilder.WithErrorHandler` | `Func<Exception, Message, bool>` | `Func<Exception, object, bool>` |
| `TopicAddressPublicationBuilder<T>.WithExceptionHandler` / `WithTopicAddress` | `Message`-typed delegates | `T`-typed delegates |
| `TopicPublicationBuilder<T>.WithTopicName` | `Func<Message, string>` | `Func<T, string>` |

The per-publication builders are now typed on their own `T` rather than `object`, so those delegates get *more* specific: a `Func<Exception, OrderPlaced, bool>` no longer needs a cast.

Implementations usually just need the parameter type widening; where you relied on `Message` members, pattern match first:

```csharp
public void Handled(object message)
{
    if (message is Message typed)
    {
        _metrics.Record(typed.Id);
    }
}
```

Explicitly typed lambdas need the same treatment — `(Exception ex, Message m) => ...` becomes `(Exception ex, object m) => ...`. Lambdas written with inferred parameters (`(ex, m) => ...`) continue to compile unchanged.

### Batch publishing is renamed to `PublishBatchAsync`

**Your v8 batch calls still compile, then fail at runtime.** A `List<T>` is itself a `class`, so `PublishAsync(messages)` now binds to the single-message `PublishAsync<TMessage>` and treats the whole list as one message. No publisher is registered for `List<T>`, so the call throws an `InvalidOperationException` that tells you to call `PublishBatchAsync`. The compiler won't find these call sites for you: search your code for `PublishAsync` calls that pass a collection. Batch publishing has its own method name:

```csharp
// Before
await publisher.PublishAsync(messages, metadata, cancellationToken);

// After
await publisher.PublishBatchAsync(messages, metadata, cancellationToken);
```

Rename batch calls accordingly. Single-message `PublishAsync` is unchanged.

### Serialization interface is generic

`IMessageBodySerializer` is now the generic `IMessageBodySerializer<T>` on the public surface (an internal type-erased seam handles the runtime boundary). If you implement a custom serializer or serialization factory, update to the generic signatures. Routing and serialization remain by each message's runtime type, as in v8: a single (or batch) publish of a base-typed instance is still routed to, and serialized by, the publisher registered for its concrete type.

Because of that, `T` is always the concrete published type in JustSaying's own path. If you construct a serializer for a base type yourself, note that the two built-in implementations differ: `SystemTextJsonMessageBodySerializer<T>` serializes the declared type `T` and omits derived-only members, while `NewtonsoftMessageBodySerializer<T>` builds its contract from the runtime type and includes them.

## Exactly-once handling requires a stable key for non-`Message` payloads

`UseExactlyOnce<TMessage>` previously deduplicated on `Message.UniqueKey()`, falling back to a fresh GUID per receive for anything else — which silently turned exactly-once into a no-op. v9 fails fast instead:

```csharp
// Message-derived types: unchanged, uses Message.UniqueKey()
pipeline.UseExactlyOnce<OrderAccepted>("orders-handler");

// Non-Message types: provide a stable deduplication key, or registration throws
pipeline.UseExactlyOnce<OrderPlaced>("orders-handler",
    deduplicationKeySelector: m => m.OrderRef);
```

If a non-`Message` type is used without a `deduplicationKeySelector`, `UseExactlyOnce` throws at registration (startup) rather than degrading silently at runtime. A selector that returns null or whitespace for a given message doesn't collapse unrelated messages onto a shared lock key: that message is not handled, an error is logged, and it stays on the queue for its redrive policy.

`UseExactlyOnce<TMessage>` on a subscription whose message type isn't a `TMessage` now throws when the bus is built, rather than failing for every message.

## A subscription's middleware configuration must add the handler

`WithMiddlewareConfiguration` replaces the default pipeline, so it has to add the handler itself with `UseDefaults<T>(handlerType)` or `UseHandler`. In v8 a configuration that didn't (for example one that only called `UseExactlyOnce`) built a pipeline that never ran the handler, and nothing was logged. v9 throws when the bus is built, naming the message type:

```csharp
c.WithMiddlewareConfiguration(m =>
    m.UseExactlyOnce<OrderAccepted>("orders-handler")
     .UseDefaults<OrderAccepted>(typeof(OrderAcceptedHandler)));
```

## New extensibility seams

Available on `IMessagingConfig`:

- **`IMessageTypeRegistry`** — bidirectional map between a message type and its logical wire name (the SNS `Subject` today). `GetLogicalName` preserves existing subject behaviour; `TryResolveType` enables future type-based inbound routing. The native `Subject` remains the unqualified type name.

It has a sensible default and requires no action unless you are customising naming.

A message that doesn't derive from `Message` has no id JustSaying can read, so publish and handle logs show its id as `(null)` and the publish activity has no `messaging.message.id` tag.
