## General Contribution Guidelines

We follow the standard GitHub fork & pull request approach to open source collaboration.
You can find an awesome description on how this works on the [gun.io blog](https://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/ "How to GitHub: Fork, Branch, Track, Squash and Pull Request").

In a nutshell:

1. Fork JustSaying to your own GitHub account.
1. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`).
1. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`) and [reference any issues](https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation "Issues 2.0: The Next Generation").
1. Push to your branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`).
1. Send a new Pull Request describing what you have done and why, in detail.
